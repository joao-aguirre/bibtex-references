school = {University of Sydney},
year = {2013},
abstract  = {Compilations of radiative view factors (often in closed analytical
form) are readily available in the open literature for commonly encountered
geometries. For more complex three-dimensional (3D) scenarios, however, the
effort required to solve the requisite multi-dimensional integrations needed to
estimate a required view factor can be daunting to say the least. In such cases,
a combination of finite element methods (where the geometry in question is
sub-divided into a large number of uniform, often triangular, elements) and
Monte Carlo Ray Tracing (MC-RT) has been developed, although frequently the
software implementation is suitable only for a limited set of geometrical
scenarios. Driven initially by a need to calculate the radiative heat transfer
occurring within an operational fibre-drawing furnace, this research set out to
examine options whereby MC-RT could be used to cost-effectively calculate any
generic 3D radiative view factor using current vectorisation technologies.}

da superfície pela temperatura média da partícula como na abordagem de
parâmetros concentrados clássica, desenvolveu-se um modelo aprimorado que
relaciona a temperatura média da partícula com a temperatura e o fluxo de calor
na superfície usando aproximações do tipo Hermite para integrais. Casos simples
foram utilizados para validar a metodologia de acoplamento proposta. O método
foi então aplicado à simulação de um leito fluidizado borbulhante do tipo
Geldart D. Os resultados obtidos foram comparados com dados experimentais de
pressão e velocidade, mostrando boa concordância. Os resultados de temperatura
mostram que a suposição da temperatura uniforme pode influenciar o cálculo da

friction coefficients, and thermal contact resistances are parametrically
varied. Decreasing the inclination angle increases the residence time and
overall heat transfer coefficient. Low values of the friction coefficients slow
the particles and increase heating, but moderate to high values of friction
dilute the flow and decrease the heat transfer. The contact resistance between

The contact resistance is altered by varying the particle roughness from 27.5 nm

results to a larger-scale system.}

accurate evaluation of the geometric view factors between equally sized spheres
in a randomly packed assembly. The procedure is a novel combination of three key
techniques: the Tanaka integral expression for the view factor between two equal
spheres, the product form of the Fibonacci integration scheme for integrals on
spheres, and the non-uniform variable scaling. The Tanaka integral not only
provides a simple integral to numerically compute the exact value of the view
factor between two unit spheres without a blockage, but also plays a fundamental
role in improving the computed shaded view factor between two spheres subject to
any blockage. The product Fibonacci integration scheme, essentially a
ray-tracing method, appears to be a low cost but sufficiently accurate cubature
for evaluating the dual-integral defining the view factor. The use of a
particular non-uniform scaling function very favourably modulates the properties
of the view factor integrals, and thus substantially improves the solution
accuracy of the Fibonacci integration scheme. Several practical issues
associated with the accuracy and efficiency of the procedure are discussed, and
test cases are provided to illustrate the applicability of the procedure.}

These phenomena include (i) shadowing, (ii) emission and (iii) adsorption by a
constant gray medium. After careful verification, we embed our algorithm in
LIGGGHTS, a solver for the DEM. A combination of LIGGGHTS and a solver for
intra-particle temperature gradients, i.e., ParScale, is then used to quantify
the relevance of radiative heat transfer rates in sheared particles beds.
Specifically, we evaluate the relative contributions of conductive, convective
and radiative thermal fluxes in granular shear flows of frictional inelastic
spheres. We find that the radiative flux can be collapsed onto single curve if
it is related to an appropriate dimensionless group. Our analysis establishes a
rationale on when radiative heat transfer in dense granular flows should be
considered or not. Also, our results can be used to close continuum-based
granular dynamics model that aim on predicting the particle temperature

technique since it can provide both macroscopic and microscopic ‘measurements’
in granular systems and allows particles of non-spherical shape to be modelled.
This ability is important since there is a common understanding that particle
shape has a strong influence on the dynamics of these systems. Here, we
critically review recent developments in DEM to model particles of non-spherical
shape. The first section of the review is concerned with advances in the
formulation and implementation of non-spherical particle models, including shape
representation, algorithms for the efficient detection of contacts and the
determination of contact parameters. In the second part, we review the main
findings obtained from numerical ‘measurements’ in granular systems containing
non-spherical particles using the DEM. The systems covered in this review
include the packing of particles, particle flow (e.g. plane shear flow, the
discharge of particles from hoppers and particle motion in vibrated beds and
rotating cylinders) and two-phase particle flows such as gas–solid fluidized

alternative to physical measurements of thermal particulate systems. Despite
their rapid advancement and successful applications to a wide range of
industrial processes, a comprehensive review of the theory that underpins the
thermal DEM-based simulations is yet to be conducted. This work presents a
critical and in-depth review of all major thermal models and heat transfer
mechanisms pertinent to DEM-based simulations. Other critical aspects such as
boundary conditions and particle body temperature distribution that were often
overlooked are also summarized and discussed, aiming to provide a clear path for
the development of robust thermal DEM-based models.

The quasi-analytical solution based on the Hertzian contact theory proves
classic and remains the main method to solving the conduction of static
contacts. Recent attempts have been mainly directed towards improving the
calculation of conduction through collisional contacts and the thin wedge of
interstitial fluid between particles. Empirical correlations that were developed
before 1981 remain predominant in calculating the fluid-particle convection
coefficient. Though more accurate, the discrete models of radiation that rely on
the solution of view factors amongst individual particles have been applied much
less than the continuum models due to the significant computational overhead.
Generally, previous efforts have led to the construction of a solid framework of
thermal DEM-based models. Significant work is required to improve existing or
develop new heat transfer sub-models, particularly those for accurate and
efficient modelling of conduction and radiation in particle-laden systems.}

anisotropic. This suggests that it is possible to dynamically tune the granular
microstructure and hence the bed's properties.}

abstract = {A ray-tracing method is presented for numerically determining
radiative view factors in complex three-dimensional geometries. This method uses
a set of “primitive” shapes to approximate the required geometry together with a
Monte Carlo simulation to track the fate of randomized rays leaving each
surface. View factors were calculated for an operational fiber drawing furnace
using both numerical integration and ray-tracing methods. Calculated view factor
profiles were essentially identical above a ray density of 105 per unit area.
Run times for the ray-tracing method were considerable longer, although the
setup time to describe a new geometry is very short and essentially independent
of system complexity.},

abstract = {The ability to model comminution techniques has been key in the
mineral processing industry and other industries where size reduction of rocks
is a key focus. With the need for more accurate and sophisticated models, the
introduction of computational models like the discrete element method (DEM) has
started to solve some of the complex problems in comminution. This review
article provides a general, though not exhaustive, overview of the application
of computational techniques to the science of comminution. Over the last two
decades the DEM has become an important tool for understanding comminution
fundamentals and providing information for the design, optimisation and
operation of comminution devices. Over that time, the application of DEM in
simulating fracture, breakage, crushing, milling and equipment wear has
increased in size and complexity. Information from DEM has contributed to
modelling techniques like, mechanistic modelling, the Unified Comminution Model
and the Virtual Comminution Machine. These have enabled step changes in
understanding of comminution processes. DEM is now widely used in industries
where comminution is critical. Important challenges remain for the next decade
including representation of unresolved fine material: prediction of its
influence on the overall processes and its size reduction. Similarly, slurry
phase transport and rheology have barely been touched on in using computational
techniques in comminution modelling. Most importantly in the future is the
uptake of the DEM outputs into standard comminution models used in design and
optimisation of equipment and processes, as despite the progress made in
understanding and in quantitative outputs the barriers to routine uptake have
not been surmounted.}

abstract = {The theoretical description of fuel conversion processes and the
numerical simulation of the equipment employed has gained considerable
industrial application throughout the last two decades. Starting from the
combustion of gaseous fuel in homogeneous turbulent flows, a basically
continuous, Eulerian fluid, the further development lead to the Lagrangian
description of droplets or pulverized solid fuel particles by independently
tracking there movement and conversion within the fluid and neglecting
collisions. Current developments in the energy sector require the consideration
of much larger particles which can no longer be considered as non-colliding
material points. Municipal waste incineration on grates [1], directly or
indirectly heated rotary kilns [2] or wood pellet combustion in domestic boilers
are such examples, where the Discrete Element Method (DEM) extends the
Lagrangian description to a mechanically and thermally fully interacting flow of
reacting granular material. In some situations with sufficiently large scale
differences distinctive interfaces can be identified between the conventional
CFD-description and the solid bed, thus allowing a separate and different
treatment of radiation in both regions. In other applications like in shaft
kilns, the radiative transfer within the moving bed enhances the effective
conductivity of the porous medium. Available commercial CFD-Codes provide
several different radiation models suitable for grey or non-grey media enclosed
by walls. They range from approaches fully neglecting interaction with the
enclosed gas phase (S2S), models describing the radiative transfer solely as a
diffusive process (P-1), directionally discretised radiative transport equations
as in the Discrete Ordinates (DO) method up to techniques explicitly relying on
rays passing through the participating media (Discrete Transfer, DTRM). The
integration of any of these radiation models into a coupled CFD-DEM code
represents a challenge and is even more complex if a distinctive separating
surface does not exist. In the work presented, the significance of using
adequate modelling of the radiative fluxes onto the surface of reacting granular
media will be discussed in the context of two technical relevant examples, the
waste conversion on reciprocating grates in municipal waste incinerators and
heat the exchange with the moving material surface in rotating kilns. The
restrictions and pitfalls in modifications of the boundary conditions for the
different radiation models will be discussed and compared with each other.}

transport devices, such as pebble-bed high temperature gas-cooled nuclear
reactors (HTGR). The effect of particle thermal radiation in packed pebble beds
has been rarely investigated at particle scale. In this work, a complete CFD-DEM
method coupled with particle-scale radiation is discussed for packed pebble
beds, considering particle motion, fluid flow, particle-fluid interactions and
heat convection, conduction and particle radiation. It is shown that, compared
to the case without particle radiation, heat transfer is enhanced greatly by
particle radiation at high temperatures. A particle radiation factor (PRF) is
proposed as an independent non-dimensional parameter to qualify the effect of
particle-scale radiation in packed pebble beds. The PRF increases significantly
with temperature and decreases gradually as the heat storage capacity or the
thermal conductivity of the fluid increases. A demonstrative utilization of the
present model is performed for a benchmark problem based on the HTR-10 nuclear
reactor, and the results in general are in agreement with the results predicted
by other empirical codes. When the nuclear reactor is above full power, the
power required by the fan will increase significantly. In the decay heat removal
process, particle radiation is essential to keep the bed temperature below the
allowable limit, which is significant for nuclear reactor safety.}

interdisciplinary research area with its core being the understanding of the
relationships between micro- and macroscopic properties of particulate/granular
matter - a state of matter that is widely encountered but poorly understood. The
macroscopic behaviour of particulate matter is controlled by the interactions
between individual particles as well as interactions with surrounding fluids.
Understanding the microscopic mechanisms in terms of these interaction forces is
therefore key to leading to truly interdisciplinary research into particulate
matter and producing results that can be generally used. This aim can be
effectively achieved via particle scale research based on detailed microdynamic
information such as the forces acting on and trajectories of individual
particles in a considered system. In recent years, such research has been
rapidly developed worldwide, mainly as a result of the rapid development of
discrete particle simulation technique and computer technology. This paper
reviews the work in this area with special reference to the discrete element
method and associated theoretical developments. It covers three important
aspects: models for the calculation of the particle–particle and particle–fluid
interaction forces, coupling of discrete element method with computational fluid
dynamics to describe particle–fluid flow, and the theories for linking discrete
to continuum modelling. Needs for future development are also discussed.}

abstract = {Understanding and modelling the dynamic behavior of particulate
systems has been a major research focus worldwide for many years. Discrete
particle simulation plays an important role in this area. This technique can
provide dynamic information, such as the trajectories of and transient forces
acting on individual particles, which is difficult to obtain by the conventional
experimental techniques. Consequently, it has been increasingly used by various
investigators for different particulate processes. In spite of the large bulk
volume, little effort has been made to comprehensively review and summarize the
progress made in the past. To overcome this gap, we have recently completed a
review of the major work in this area in two separate parts. The first part has
been published [Zhu, H.P., Zhou, Z.Y., Yang, R.Y., Yu, A.B., 2007. Discrete
particle simulation of particulate systems: theoretical developments. Chemical
Engineering Science 62, 3378–3392.], which reviews the major theoretical
developments. This paper is the second one, aiming to provide a summary of the
studies based on discrete particle simulation in the past two decades or so. The
studies are categorized into three subject areas: particle packing, particle
flow, and particle–fluid flow. The major findings are discussed, with emphasis
on the microdynamics including packing/flow structure and particle–particle,
particle–fluid and particle–wall interaction forces. It is concluded that
discrete particle simulation is an effective method for particle scale research
of particulate matter. The needs for future research are also discussed.}
